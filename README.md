# ft_vox

This project is about creating a minecraft engine in C++ and OpenGL.
The key feature is productivity and biomes generation.
There is just a few other features, like transparency (but it is not finished), rivers generation,
special blocks, flowers and UI.   

## Installation

Firstly install external libraries : 
```
./tools/install_libraries.sh
```

Then build the project :
```
./tools/build_project.sh
```

Now you can run executable :
```
./ft_vox
```
